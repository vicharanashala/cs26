# OAQ & Threads System — Vicharanashala
**Once Asked Questions · Threaded discussions · SP & Wallet System · MERN Stack · v2.0**

Every query the team answers once becomes a permanent asset. Subsequent interns get that answer in under three seconds without human involvement.

---

## What's New in v2.0

### React Router Navigation
- URL-based routing with proper browser back/forward support
- Routes: `/` (OAQ), `/threads`, `/tracker`, `/sp`, `/admin`
- Last visited route persisted in localStorage
- Shareable direct links to any page

### Dark Mode
- Fully implemented CSS variable-based theming
- Toggle with `☀️`/`🌙` button in Topbar
- WCAG AA compliant contrast ratios

---

## Design Philosophy & Theme
- **Strict Monochrome**: Sleek, premium dark/light mode styled entirely with CSS custom properties (variables) under WCAG AA compliance.
- **Micro-animations**: Enhanced transition states, real-time Socket.io state synchronization, and audio voice playback (en-IN accent adapter pattern).
- **Modal-based UI**: Consistent modal components replacing browser `prompt()` dialogs

---

## Quick Start (Unified Flow)

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js 20 LTS** or higher
- **MongoDB 7** running locally or via Atlas connection URI

### Setup & Startup
Initialize the entire project with a single command from the root directory:

```powershell
# 1. Install all dependencies for both client and server.
npm run install:all

# 2. Seed baseline sections, FAQ entries, and superadmin/mentor/intern accounts
npm run seed

# 3. Spin up both backend (port 5001) and frontend (port 5173) concurrently
npm run dev
```

**Startup Issues?** See [STARTING.md](./STARTING.md) for troubleshooting.

**Demo accounts seeded by default:**
| Email | Password | Role | Access Level |
|---|---|---|---|
| superadmin@demo.com | demo1234 | superadmin | Complete moderation, adjustments, creation |
| admin@demo.com | demo1234 | admin | Seed baseline, adjust user SP, add sections |
| mentor@demo.com | demo1234 | mentor | Flag queries, promote answers, sign off resolution |
| intern@demo.com | demo1234 | intern | Raise queries, upvote, submit FCFS answers |

## Dynamic Theme Design System
Our client features custom CSS variable injection mapping dynamically across Light and Dark states:

```css
/* Tokens declared dynamically under ThemeContext */
--color-bg             /* Core workspace background */
--color-surface        /* Card & table cells background */
--color-surface-hover  /* Alternating row and button highlights */
--color-border         /* Layout dividing lines */
--color-text-primary   /* Headings and body readable contrast */
--color-text-secondary /* Detail and descriptive paragraphs */
--color-text-muted     /* Timestamps and indices placeholders */
--color-invert-bg      /* Dynamic inversion for prominent buttons */
--color-invert-text    /* High-contrast text on inverted backgrounds */
```
